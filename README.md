## <div align="center">**Table of Scripts:**</div>

----------------------------------------

**The scripts themselves are ordered in this way: *Executables* are in the root of each folder, and *sourceable* scripts that other scripts call upon for functions are stored in the appropriately labeled folders. *Old* folders are for storing older scripts that I wish to use in future frankenstein monsters.**

- [**Apple Scripts**](/Apple_Scripts)
  - Written mostly in Zsh, most of the scripts are also Bash Compatible, and a preference towards portability was attempted with each. When in doubt check the Shebang.


- [**Linux Scripts**](/Linux_Scripts)
  - Written mostly in Zsh, most of the scripts are similarly Bash Compatible, I do attempt to mark in the Shebang's which is which as needed.


- [**Windows Scripts**](/Windows_Scripts)
  - Written mostly in Powershell with a little CMD thrown in for certain situations, there is also a small library of sourceable functions.  

---------------------------------------

*These are available for others to use as they see fit, I never mind a small credit in the code, I don't have to see it and don't demand it.*
