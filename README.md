## <div align="center">**Table of Scripts:**</div>

----------------------------------------

**The scripts themselves are ordered in this way: *Executables* are in the root of each folder, and *sourceable* scripts that other scripts call upon for functions are stored in the appropriately labeled folders. *Old* folders are for storing older scripts that I wish to use in future frankenstein monsters.**

- [**Apple Scripts**](https://github.com/saintphaenixos/Script-Repository/tree/CurrentWorkingScripts/Apple%20Scripts)
  - Written mostly in Zsh, most of the scripts are also Bash Compatible, and a preference towards portability was attempted with each. When in doubt check the Shebang.

- [**BSD Scripts**](https://github.com/saintphaenixos/Script-Repository/tree/CurrentWorkingScripts/BSD%20scripts/)
  - Written in bash and rarely tcsh, these scripts are largely for setting up BSD Operating systems to my preferences, but their utility varies.

- [**Crystal Programs**](https://github.com/saintphaenixos/Script-Repository/tree/CurrentWorkingScripts/Crystal)
  - Written in Crystal Language, these are my first compiled programs.

- [**Linux Scripts**](https://github.com/saintphaenixos/Script-Repository/tree/CurrentWorkingScripts/Linux%20scripts)
  - Written mostly in Zsh, most of the scripts are similarly Bash Compatible, I do attempt to mark in the Shebang's which is which as needed.

- [**Windows Scripts**](https://github.com/saintphaenixos/Script-Repository/tree/CurrentWorkingScripts/Windows%20Scripts)
  - Written mostly in Powershell with a little CMD thrown in for certain situations, there is also a small library of sourceable functions.
