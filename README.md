# This is a repository of My scripts for my Job:

In here we will see the general layout, I generally write most scripts in Powershell due to my environment, however will write bash and Zsh scripts as needed for my own environment.

These are available for others to use as they see fit, I never mind a small credit in the code, I don't have to see it.

Happy Scriptin'!
