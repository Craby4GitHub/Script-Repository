      NAME

            filsystemlist.sh - Script for displaying mounted filesystems and
            their models.

      SYNOPSIS

            filesystem.sh - Usage

      DESCRIPTION

            This is a script that outputs all needed information regarding
            mounted disk devices on a bash compatible system. It is able to
            sort by several flags to order the data more appropriately for
            viewing.

            The script is available with these Arguments:

            -filesystem, -filesystem
                    Sort by filesystem name alphabetically. This is also
                    given as the default option in the case of no command
                    flags.

            -type, -Type
                    Sort by filesystem type.

            -size, -Size
                    Sort by hard disk Capacity.

            -used, -Used
                    Sort by the Used Capacity of the
                    hard disk.

            -available, -Available
                    Sort by Available space remaining
                    on the hard disk.

            -use, -Use
                    Sort by the Percentage of used
                    space on the hard disk.

            -mount, -Mount
                    Sort by mount point.
